# sketchbook

👨🏽‍🔬 experiments in generative art

### Getting Started

This project is using [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch) which allows you to scaffold and run sketches.

Install the CLI tool globally `npm install canvas-sketch-cli -g`

To start a sketch run `npm start <sketch_filename.js>`. This will start a development server with features such as live-reloading, export, etc. For more info, see [Installing and Using canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch/blob/master/docs/installation.md)

For example, to run the `10-print.js` sketch you would run `npm start 10-print.js`
